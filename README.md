# Capstone Project1: Spotify Audio Features
This project aims to find a model that predicts the popularity of a song in the dataset based on the song's audio features. 

### Features and the Target Variable: 

#### Features

acousticness        
danceability        
duration_ms         
energy              
instrumentalness,   
key                
liveness            
loudness            
mode             
speechiness         
tempo             
time_signature      
valence             

#### Target Variable:
Popularity - A number between 0 - 100, which is calculated based on the number of times a song was played

### Approach and Results:
After performing data cleaning/wrangling, visualizations and exploratory analysis, supervised learning algorithms were used to train multivariate models. Since the outcome is numerical, this would be a regresison probelem. The regressors used were LASSO and Gradient Boosting Regression. Gradient Boosting performed better than LASSO by achieving:
- R2 on train data: **0.14**
- R2 on test data: **0.12**
- MSE on test data = **4.2**
